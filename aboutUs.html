						Off-Da-Hook Flexbooks is a company developed by four eager and talented University of California, Irvine students in April 2020. These four were brought together by their collective goal to complete a working e-commerce textbook website that would benefit their needs. As students, they understood that the market for textbooks would always be needed. Thus, they wanted to create something that would be useful not only for themselves but also for students and educators across the country of all ages.
						<br><br>
						Off-Da-Hook Flexbooks strives to offer textbooks as well as study materials from a breadth of subjects and expertise levels. The website also makes sure to keep up-to-date with the newest editions of textbooks while providing older editions to those that prefer it. Its goal is to offer a one-stop-shop for students when purchasing their textbooks for the school term.
						<br><br>
						Ensuring that their customers are highly satisfied with using the service, the team at Off-Da-Hook Flexbooks makes customer service their top priority. The Off-Da-Hook Flexbooks team works to provide their customers with a user-friendly and intuitive website. The team hopes to be able to build a relationship with their customers and value their patron as well as feedback. Thus, the Off-Da-Hook Flexbooks Help Desk is always open for their customers to ask questions, express concerns, or offer feedback.
